## What I learned 
During the development of this Tanishq clone, I gained hands-on experience in structuring web pages using HTML and styling them using CSS.

Additionally, this project helped me understand the importance of attention to detail in mimicking the design of a complex web application.Also got an experience woking in a team along with colaboration.
